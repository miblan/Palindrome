# Palindrome
<p>Gamemaker Studio is a 2D engine. I wanted to challenge myself by making my dream horror game: a minimalistic 3D first person survival-horror experience.</p>
<p>It features low-poly 3D models, pixelated UI and billboard-rendered items & monster(s).</p>
<p>The game has a strong focus on confusing the player and to make them constantly in fear of what might lurk in the ever-closing darkness.</p>
